# ü§ñ Gemini Telegram Bot

A versatile Telegram bot built with Python that allows users to chat with Google Gemini models. It supports multimodal input (text and photos), maintains conversation history, offers flexible deployment (Webhook or Polling), and provides user-specific configuration options via commands and buttons. The bot leverages `MarkdownV2` for rich text formatting, including code blocks, file sending, and Mermaid chart rendering.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **ü§ñ AI Chat:** Interact with Google Gemini models (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest` by default or user-selected).
*   **üìùüì∏ Multimodal Input:** Send text messages or photos with captions to the bot.
*   **üíæ Conversation History:** The bot remembers previous turns (text and photo captions/placeholders) to maintain context in the conversation (history length is limited by model context window and a configurable limit).
*   **üîë User API Keys:** Users can set and use their own Google Gemini API key using `/set_api_key` for potentially higher limits or access to models available to their key.
*   **üåç Bot's Default Key:** A default API key can be configured for users who don't provide their own (can be limited to a certain number of messages via `DEFAULT_KEY_MESSAGE_LIMIT`).
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Model Selection:** Users can easily list available Gemini models (`/list_models`) and select one using the `/select_model` command with inline keyboard buttons.
*   **üìä Current Settings:** View active API key status, chosen model, and default key message count using `/current_settings`.
*   **‚Ü©Ô∏è Chat Reset:** Clear conversation history using `/reset`.
*   **üöÄ Flexible Deployment:** Supports both **Webhook** mode (recommended for production, requires a publicly accessible server) and **Long Polling** mode (easier for local development and testing).
*   **üíÖ Rich Formatting (Thanks to [telegramify-markdown](https://github.com/sudoskys/telegramify-markdown/)):**
    *   Properly formats Markdown in AI responses for Telegram (`MarkdownV2`).
    *   Sends code blocks detected in responses as downloadable `.txt` files for better readability and usability.
    *   Renders Mermaid diagrams (e.g., flowcharts, sequence diagrams) directly in the chat if the AI generates them in a Mermaid code block.
    *   Latex Visualization (escaped) and Expanded Citation.

## üìù Important Notes & Context


*   **üí° Project Origin:** Developed as a practical exercise and demonstration following the **GDG Berlin "Using AI to help solve problems, both big and small!"** event, exploring Google Gemini's capabilities through iterative development.
*   **Limited Multimodal History:** While the bot accepts photos and stores related information, the AI model might not fully "re-see" the image content from previous turns due to API/architectural constraints. Context relies mainly on text placeholders and captions.
*   **Free Tier Considerations:** Deploying on free tiers (like Railway, Supabase) comes with limitations (usage, resources, cold starts) affecting performance. But you can enable a paid plan for handling more users if needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Running

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Python 3.11+
*   Git
*   Poetry (see [Poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation))
*   A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account and project.
*   A [Telegram Bot Token](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather). You might want **two** tokens: one for production deployment and one specifically for local testing.
*   A [Google AI Studio / Google Cloud Project](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to get a Gemini API Key (can be used as the bot's default or provided by users).

### 2. Supabase Database Setup

*   In your Supabase project dashboard, go to the "SQL Editor".
*   Create a new query and run the following SQL to create the necessary tables:

    ```sql
    -- Create user_settings table
    CREATE TABLE public.user_settings (
      chat_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
      gemini_api_key TEXT NULL,
      selected_model TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest',
      message_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
    );

    -- Optional: Add comments for clarity
    COMMENT ON TABLE public.user_settings IS 'Stores user-specific settings like API keys and selected models.';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.user_settings.chat_id IS 'Telegram Chat ID (Primary Key)';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.user_settings.gemini_api_key IS 'User-provided Gemini API Key (nullable)';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.user_settings.selected_model IS 'Gemini model selected by the user';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.user_settings.message_count IS 'Message counter for users on the default API key';


    -- Create chat_history table
    CREATE TABLE public.chat_history (
      chat_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
      turn_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
      role TEXT NOT NULL,
      parts_json JSONB NULL, -- Can be NULL if a turn has no content (e.g., initial state)
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(), -- Optional: Track creation time
      PRIMARY KEY (chat_id, turn_index) -- Composite primary key
    );

    -- Optional: Add comments
    COMMENT ON TABLE public.chat_history IS 'Stores the conversation history turns.';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.chat_history.chat_id IS 'Telegram Chat ID';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.chat_history.turn_index IS 'Sequential index of the turn within a chat';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.chat_history.role IS 'Role of the turn owner (user or model)';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.chat_history.parts_json IS 'JSONB array storing the parts (text, image placeholders) of the turn';

    -- Optional but Recommended: Create an index for faster history lookups
    CREATE INDEX idx_chat_history_chat_id_turn_index ON public.chat_history(chat_id, turn_index);
    ```
*   **(Security Note):** The provided code typically uses the Supabase `service_role` key, which bypasses Row Level Security (RLS). If you need finer-grained control or plan to expose Supabase keys differently, configure RLS appropriately.

### 3. Local Setup & Running (Polling Mode)

This is recommended for development and testing.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohamadghaffari/gemini-tel-bot
    cd <gemini-tel-bot>
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies & Prepare Environment:** Poetry will create and manage a virtual environment for you.
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    Poetry automatically manages the project's virtual environment. To execute commands within this environment, you have two main options:

    *   **Using `poetry run` (Recommended for most single commands):**
        This is the simplest way for one-off commands, like starting the bot. Poetry handles executing the command within the correct isolated environment.
        Example: `poetry run run-gemini-bot`

    *   **Activating the environment in your current shell (for multiple commands):**
        If you want to run multiple commands without typing `poetry run` each time, you can activate the virtual environment directly in your current shell session. The command depends on your shell:
        *   **Bash/Zsh:**
            ```bash
            eval "$(poetry env activate)"
            ```
        *   **Fish:**
            ```fish
            poetry env activate fish | source
            ```
        *   **PowerShell:**
            ```powershell
            poetry env activate ps1 | Invoke-Expression
            ```
        After running the appropriate command, your shell prompt might change to indicate the active environment (e.g., `(gemini-tel-bot-py3.11) $`). You can then run the script directly (e.g., `run-gemini-bot` if it's on PATH, or use `poetry run run-gemini-bot`). To "deactivate" or leave this state, it's usually easiest to close the current terminal tab/window and open a new one.

3.  **Create `.env` File:** Create a file named `.env` in the project root by copying `.env.example` (e.g., `cp .env.example .env`). **Do not commit the `.env` file to Git!** It should already be in your `.gitignore`. Populate `.env` with your **local testing credentials**:
    ```dotenv
    # .env - For Local Development Only
    BOT_MODE=polling
    BOT_API_KEY=<YOUR_LOCAL_TESTING_BOT_TOKEN> # Use a SEPARATE token for testing
    SUPABASE_URL=<YOUR_SUPABASE_URL>
    SUPABASE_KEY=<YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY> # Use service_role key
    GEMINI_BOT_DEFAULT_API_KEY=<YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY> # Optional default key
    ```
4.  **Run the Bot (Polling Mode):**
    ```bash
    poetry run run-gemini-bot
    ```
    The bot will start polling Telegram for updates using your *local testing* bot token. You can interact with this test bot instance. Use `Ctrl+C` to stop.

### 4. Production Deployment (Webhook Mode - e.g., Railway)

This uses a web server (Gunicorn) to handle updates via a webhook.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   A Git repository with your latest code pushed.
    *   A [Railway](https://railway.com?referralCode=6U8dFG) account (or similar PaaS supporting Python WSGI apps).
2.  **Code Structure:** Ensure your project includes:
    *   `pyproject.toml` (Defines dependencies and project metadata for Poetry. Railway will use this to install dependencies.)
    *   `poetry.lock` (Ensures deterministic builds by locking dependency versions. Crucial for reproducible deployments on Railway.)
    *   `Procfile` (e.g., `web: poetry run gunicorn api.webhook:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`)
    *   `src/gemini_tel_bot/cli.py` (Handles polling mode startup, invoked by `run-gemini-bot` script).
    *   `api/webhook.py` (WSGI entry point).
    *   All other Python modules (`bot.py`, `handlers.py`, `config.py`, etc.).
3.  **Railway Project Setup:**
    *   Create a new Railway project linked to your Git repository.
    *   Railway should detect the `Procfile` and, given the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files, will use Poetry to build your environment.
4.  **Configure Environment Variables on Railway:**
    *   In Railway's "Variables" tab, set the following (use your **production** credentials):
        *   `BOT_MODE`: `webhook` (Ensure this is set)
        *   `BOT_API_KEY`: `<YOUR_PRODUCTION_BOT_TOKEN>`
        *   `SUPABASE_URL`: `<YOUR_SUPABASE_URL>`
        *   `SUPABASE_KEY`: `<YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY>`
        *   `GEMINI_BOT_DEFAULT_API_KEY`: `<YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY>` (Optional)
        *   `PYTHON_VERSION`: `3.11` (Or your target Python version, good practice for Railway)
5.  **Deploy:** Railway will build and deploy based on your Git pushes. Monitor build/deploy logs.
6.  **Set Telegram Webhook:**
    *   Get your Railway service's public URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`).
    *   Construct the full webhook URL: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/api/webhook` (This assumes your `api/webhook.py` defines a route that results in this path. For example, if `api/webhook.py` creates a Flask app with `@app.route('/api/webhook')`, or a Blueprint mounted at `/api` with a `/webhook` route).
    *   Set the webhook via browser or `curl`:
        ```
        https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_PRODUCTION_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<YOUR_FULL_WEBHOOK_URL>
        ```
        Verify the success response from Telegram.

## üéÆ Usage

Start a chat with your bot on Telegram (either the local test instance or the deployed production one).

*   Send text messages or photos with captions to chat with the AI.
*   Look out for formatted responses, code sent as files, and rendered Mermaid diagrams!
*   Use commands:
    *   `/start` or `/help`: Show welcome message and commands list.
    *   `/reset`: Clear your chat history.
    *   `/set_api_key`: Start setting your personal Gemini API key.
    *   `/clear_api_key`: Revert to the bot's default key.
    *   `/list_models`: List models available with your current API key.
    *   `/select_model`: Choose a model via buttons.
    *   `/current_settings`: Show your current configuration.

## üêõ Debugging

*   **Local (Polling):** Check the console output where you ran `poetry run run-gemini-bot`. Increase log levels if needed (see `src/gemini_tel_bot/cli.py`).
*   **Production (Webhook):**
    *   **Railway Logs:** Your primary debugging tool.
    *   **Telegram Webhook Info:** Use `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo` to check for errors reported by Telegram (`last_error_message`, `last_error_date`) and the pending update count. Ensure the URL matches exactly what you set.
    *   **Database:** Verify Supabase credentials and table structure.
    *   **AI API:** Check API keys and model validity.
